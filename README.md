## Description

Program (in C language) for finding a path from point A to point B. Prince is looking for his princess.
Program will load 2-dimensional map from file then scan the whole map for prince and princess.
If there is either no prince or princess an error message will appear. 
However if there are both of them path finding algorithm will mark the road and print it into output.

This program was built by me as a part of my assignment from algorithms in C language.
